# compile node helper

> Helps you compile Node.js from source by automating what should be automated

## Usage

Download `main.bash` from `dist/`

To start and choose version interactively.

```sh
./main.bash
```

To skip interaction and download version.

```sh
./main.bash --version=x.x.x
```

Clean script files on `~/.compile-node-helper`

_deletes everything!_

```sh
./main.bash --clean
```
